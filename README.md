## ETL project using MRTS data

This project uses Monthly Retail Trade Survey data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau. I first prepare the data by an Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process. Once the data was loaded into a SQL table, I am able to perform analysis and visualization using Python. I explore trends by annualizing data, plotting percentage changes, and exploring rolling time windows to smooth the data and gain a further understanding in the economic trends for different business types.
